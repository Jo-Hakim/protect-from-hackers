                               Our fear has expanded from thieves who invade homes and steal belongings, to also being afraid while we are in our homes from those who lurk for us on the internet, making us stop for a moment to think about the level of anxiety and danger brought by this advanced revolution, despite the great positives it provided us, it is undoubtedly a double-edged sword!
                           <br> Hacking and unauthorized access over the internet has become a source of anxiety and terror that   creeps into our depths. The theft of sensitive information is extremely dangerous as it may lead to blackmail and many other bad things. Therefore, it is necessary to take the highest precautions and follow precautionary measures to protect ourselves from hacking effectively to avoid falling into the clutches of hackers.
                           <br> The past few years have recorded more cases of piracy and data breaches that internet users have faced. The frequency of fraud and infiltration has increased, making all internet-connected data vulnerable to risk.
                           <br> Hackers or intruders, or whatever the name, use deceptive methods to invade your online account, giving them the space to access your passwords, bank details, and many other problems that those who are hacked will face.
                           <br> Recent studies indicated that the year 2023 was full of problems and hacks of online accounts. Hacker gangs managed to infiltrate social media accounts, email accounts, and bank accounts at a very high rate, breaking the 354% barrier, specifically for those who did not follow any method of self-protection from hacking. Therefore, we want to stand together on the best ways to protect yourself from hacking in 2024:

                           <p>
                               <br> A strong and unpredictable password is your shield from hackers accessing your various types of data. Therefore, you would have built a massive protective wall against cyber attacks on your bank and social accounts, among others, by creating a strong password that cannot be guessed by others.
                               <br> So, take your time and do not rush to choose a password when creating any type of account online. To double the security dose, we can offer you the following tips:
                               <ul dir="ltr">
                                   <font size="5">
                                       <li dir="ltr">Long and difficult passwords. A group of cybersecurity experts recommends creating long and difficult passwords that are not related to your personal life at all. It is recommended to choose 10 letters, symbols, and numbers when creating this password; but don't forget to save and record it so you don't have difficulty accessing your accounts.</li>

                                       <li dir="ltr">Different passwords for your accounts. It is better to set different passwords for your accounts so that hackers or intruders cannot access all your accounts at once.</li>

                                   <font size="5">
                                       <li dir="ltr">Breaking away from the usual and conventional in passwords. Many tend to use symbols like !!! or &&& in their passwords, but why not come up with a different symbol that is difficult to predict to use in your password?</li>

                               </ul>

                               In fact, two-factor authentication is the perfect choice to enhance the security and protection layer in your online accounts, as it is impossible for hackers to hack fingerprints or face recognition, for example, and other methods that are under your control.
                               <br> For instance, when choosing the method of entering a password with sending a confirmation code to your phone number or authentication from another device you own (such as between a laptop and a phone), you get a very high level of security.
                               <br> Google pointed out that enabling two-factor authentication significantly enhances your security level, making the likelihood of your accounts being hacked decrease by 50%.
                               <br> If you haven't enabled this feature yet, you can go to the two-factor authentication settings in your Google account and select the number of security steps you want to activate. With this step, you will have achieved a high level of security.

                               Surely you have specified a backup account during the process of creating your Google account for the first time; this is a precautionary and security step that makes it easy for you to recover your account in case of hacking or forgetting the password, making you more secure. You can also specify an active phone number to be a reference for receiving the password or code if you want to access it.
                               Specifying a backup email and phone number builds a security wall between you and hackers, making your exposure to danger very unlikely, as this method ensures a reduction in the exposure to frightening consequences.

                               Have you ever received a notification from Facebook about someone trying to access your account? This is a phishing warning procedure. If you are not the one trying to access, it means someone is trying to hack your account, but the attempt failed due to the activation of notifications.
                               <br> Not only that, but there are several ways you might be exposed to phishing such as emails, text messages, phone calls, etc., impersonating companies or organizations trying to trap you. Therefore, we provide you with a set of ideas and methods that make it easy for you to discover the matter:
                               <ul>
                                   <font size="5">
                                       <li>Verify the sender's details in terms of number, profile, etc. Note that unwanted messages or those reported by others show a red mark indicating they are dangerous.</li>

                                   <font size="5">
                                       <li>Check all details regarding urgency and threats. Hackers use methods of intimidation and fear to rush you to respond or do what is required, such as claiming you have committed a legal violation that may expose you to a fine or imprisonment, which scares you.</li>

                                   <font size="5">
                                       <li>Poor details reveal the phishing attempt. In fact, when you closely examine phishing messages impersonating others, you will notice deep flaws in the pictures, strange formatting, poor language, etc., which easily reveals the matter to you.</li>
                                   </font>
                               </ul>

                           <font size="6">
                               <li dir="ltr">Avoid the idea of clicking on suspicious links in emails and messages in general</li>

                           <p>
                               Do not give yourself the freedom to explore the unknown and what lies behind those links you received in text messages, emails, or even through your social accounts. Your curiosity might lead you to misery because these suspicious links often hide hacking and malware behind them, leading to an endless ordeal.
                               <br> It is necessary to pay attention to downloading antivirus applications and scanning links before use to avoid falling into the traps of phishing and hacking.
                           </p>

                               Safe Browsing tools make it easier for you to protect yourself from hacking; they provide you with advanced techniques to detect fake websites and alert you about malicious programs and phishing attempts behind the links you intend to click on, keeping you safe.
                               <br> Safe Browsing tools also help in warning and completely preventing you from accessing unsafe websites, doubling the level of privacy protection during browsing by blocking annoying site tracking tools.

                               The aging of software versions increases the vulnerabilities that allow hackers and intruders to reach you. Therefore, you should maintain program and application updates to avoid hacking, and it is recommended to enable automatic program updates if a new version is available.
                               <br> If you are an Android device user, automatic program updates are available once you access your profile icon through the Google Play Store; you will then see settings and preferences to finally click on automatic program updates.
                               For IOS device holders, it's different; you just need to go to settings, then click on General and automatic updates under Software Update. Your device will then be ready to start updating once a new version is released.

                               Often we need to sit in public places like cafes or restaurants that provide Wi-Fi service for customers, and we all hurry to connect to the internet for better use; but we don't realize that we become an easier prey for phishing and trapping! Therefore, we need to use a VPN when connecting to public Wi-Fi.
                               The need for precautions and security measures rises with the intention of typing sensitive data on your device while connected to that network outside your home, as the VPN gives you the chance to stay safe from the eyes of intruders trying to access your data and information without any right.

                               Some people resort to jailbreaking their phones to get apps from external sources. Although they enjoy what they get, they become extremely vulnerable to intruders and hackers on the network. Jailbreaking or removing protection completely lifts the security and safety from your phone, and unfortunately, once removed, you can't undo it.
